##  🧱 Constructors in Java:

This folder contains beginner-friendly Java examples demonstrating the use of constructors.

## 📌 What is a Constructor?

A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.
It is mainly used to initialize data members of a class.

## Concepts Covered:

- Non-parameterized constructors

- Parameterized constructors

- Constructor overloading

- Copy constructors

## 🧠 Supporting OOP Concepts:

- Classes and Objects

- Methods

- Object creation
  
- How to combine constructors with methods for real-world tasks

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn:

- How constructors initialize objects

- How different constructors are used during object creation

- How to create a new object from an existing object using a copy constructor

## 💡 Notes:
- Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.
- A constructor is automatically called when an object is created.
- You can overload constructors to provide multiple ways of initializing an object.

- Timer.java
-------------
- Demonstrates parameterized constructors to initialize object state
- Shows method usage and looping for countdown
- Includes exception handling for Thread interruptions
- Prints formatted time using display() method
