##  🧱 Constructors in Java:

This folder contains beginner-friendly Java examples demonstrating the use of constructors.

## 📌 What is a Constructor?

A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object of a class is created.
It is mainly used to initialize data members of a class.

## Concepts Covered:

• Non-parameterized constructors

• Parameterized constructors

• Constructor overloading

• Copy constructors

## 🧠 Supporting OOP Concepts:

• Classes and Objects

• Methods

• Object creation

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn:

• How constructors initialize objects

• How different constructors are used during object creation

• How to create a new object from an existing object using a copy constructor

## 💡 Notes:
• Constructors do not have a return type, not even void.
• A constructor is automatically called when an object is created.
• You can overload constructors to provide multiple ways of initializing an object.

## 📂 Examples in this folder:
• Rectangle.java (Non-parameterized and parameterized constructors)
• Account.java (Constructors with deposit/withdraw methods)
• Circle.java (Parameterized constructors)
• Distance.java
• Marks.java
• Time.java
- CopyConstructorExample.java

Each example is simple and focuses on understanding constructors in Java.
