## Polymorphism in Java 🔄 :

Polymorphism is an OOP concept that allows a single method or object to take many forms.
It enables the same method name to behave differently depending on the object or parameters used.

This folder contains beginner-friendly Java examples demonstrating polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming.

## Concepts Covered:

• Method overloading (compile-time polymorphism)

• Method overriding (runtime polymorphism)

• Using polymorphism with parent and child classes

## 🧠 Supporting Concepts:

• Classes & Objects

• Methods

• Inheritance

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn:

• How the same method name can behave differently based on parameters or object type

• How polymorphism improves code flexibility and reusability

• How to combine polymorphism with inheritance for real-world designs



Each example focuses on practical use of polymorphism in Java.
