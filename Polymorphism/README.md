## Polymorphism in Java 🔄 :

Polymorphism is an OOP concept that allows a method or an object to take many forms.
It enables the same method name to behave differently depending on the object or parameters used.

This folder contains beginner-friendly Java examples demonstrating polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming.

## Concepts Covered:

- Method overloading (compile-time polymorphism)

- Method overriding (runtime polymorphism)

- Using polymorphism with parent and child classes

## 🧠 Supporting Concepts:

- Classes & Objects

- Methods

- Inheritance

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn:

- How the same method name can behave differently based on parameters or object type

- How polymorphism improves code flexibility and reusability

- How to combine polymorphism with inheritance for real-world designs


## 💡 Notes:

- Compile-time polymorphism is achieved via method overloading.

- Runtime polymorphism is achieved via method overriding.

- Polymorphism helps write cleaner and more reusable code.

## 📂 Examples in this folder:

- PenExample.java → Demonstrates basic object-level polymorphism

- StudentMethodOverload.java → Demonstrates compile-time polymorphism using method overloading

- AnimalOverrideExample.java → Demonstrates runtime polymorphism using method overriding


Each example focuses on practical use of polymorphism in Java.
