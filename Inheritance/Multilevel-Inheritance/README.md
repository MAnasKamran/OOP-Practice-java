## 🧬 Multilevel Inheritance in Java:

- Definition:
Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming where a class is derived from another derived class, forming a chain of parent → child → grandchild classes.

This folder contains beginner-friendly Java examples demonstrating multilevel inheritance, where a class is derived from another derived class.

## 📌 What is Multilevel Inheritance?

In multilevel inheritance, a class can inherit properties and methods from a parent class, which itself inherits from another class.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered:

- Base, intermediate, and derived classes
- use of extends keyword
- Method inheritance
- Method overriding
- Use of super keyword
- protected access modifier

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn:

- How properties and methods are passed through multiple class levels
- How subclasses reuse and extend parent class functionality
- How multilevel inheritance improves code reusability and structure


Each example focuses on understanding inheritance hierarchies in Java.
