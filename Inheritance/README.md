## Inheritance in Java 🌳:

Inheritance is an OOP concept that allows a class (child/derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent/base class).
It helps reuse code, organize programs better, and build relationships between classes.

This folder contains beginner-friendly Java examples demonstrating inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming.

## Concepts Covered:

• Base (parent) and derived (child) classes

• Method inheritance

• Simple method overloading (polymorphism)

## 🧠 Supporting Concepts:

• Classes & Objects

• Methods

• Constructors

## 🎯 What You’ll Learn:

• How child classes inherit properties and methods from parent classes

• How to use method overloading to demonstrate polymorphism

• How inheritance helps organize code and promote reusability



Each example focuses on practical use of inheritance in Java.
